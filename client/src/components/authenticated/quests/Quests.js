Mix 1/2 cup vinegar or 2-3 teaspoons salt in the water. Wash the ladysfingers in this water thoroughly. This will eliminnate the need to wash them 2-3 times under running water and also save water. Move these into a strainer and wash them under running water once. Let's wash cluster beans now. Wash them in a similar fashion as ladysfingers. Same with gerkins/tindoora. Always wash vegetables before putting them in the fridge. Let's clean tomatoes now. Put tomatoes in bowl of water and soak them for 5 minutes. Move them into a strainer and wash them under running water. Let's see how to clean carrots. Cut off the ends of carrots. Wash them under running water till all the dirt is gone. Let's see how to clean ginger. Break ginger into pieces and soak it in water for half an hour. If we soak ginger in the beginning, then it will be soaked in the time we clean and store other vegetables. Wash the soaked ginger till all the dirt is gone. Leave them to dry on a kitchen towel. Put the cleaned ladysfingers, cluster beans and gerkins/tindoora in zip lock bags or netted bags and store them in the fridge. Store carrots in an air tight container. Dry the ginger pieces with a cloth and put then in a cover with paper towels as shown. Paper towels absorb the excess water in ginger pieces. Seal the cover such that there is no air in the bag. Let's see how to store vegetables that are to be stored outside. Choose a shelf that gets ample light and air. This will keep the vegetables fresh for a longer period of time. Here I put onions and potatoes in the bottom shelf. On the upper shelf I put cleaned tomatoes. Capsicum also could be stored here by putting them in a net bag as shown. Put garlics in a basket or any open container as shown. ",
